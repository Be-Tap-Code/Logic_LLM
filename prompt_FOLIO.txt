Given a problem description and a question. The task is to parse the problem and the question into first-order logic formulars.
The grammar of the first-order logic formular is defined as follows:
1) logical conjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ∧ expr2
2) logical disjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ∨ expr2
3) logical exclusive disjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ⊕ expr2
4) logical negation of expr1: ¬expr1
5) expr1 implies expr2: expr1 → expr2
6) expr1 if and only if expr2: expr1 ↔ expr2
7) logical universal quantification: ∀x
8) logical existential quantification: ∃x

Problem:
∀x (DrinkRegularly(x, coffee) → IsDependentOn(x, caffeine))
∀x (DrinkRegularly(x, coffee) ∨ (¬WantToBeAddictedTo(x, caffeine)))
∀x (¬WantToBeAddictedTo(x, caffeine) → ¬AwareThatDrug(x, caffeine))
¬(Student(rina) ⊕ ¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine))
¬(IsDependentOn(rina, caffeine) ⊕ Student(rina))
Question:
¬WantToBeAddictedTo(rina, caffeine) ∨ (¬AwareThatDrug(rina, caffeine))
###
Predicates:
Dependent(x) ::: x is a person dependent on caffeine.
Drinks(x) ::: x regularly drinks coffee.
Jokes(x) ::: x jokes about being addicted to caffeine.
Unaware(x) ::: x is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
Student(x) ::: x is a student.
Premises:
∀x (Drinks(x) → Dependent(x)) ::: All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine.
∀x (Drinks(x) ⊕ Jokes(x)) ::: People eithe  r regularly drink coffee or joke about being addicted to caffeine.
∀x (Jokes(x) → ¬Unaware(x)) ::: No one who jokes about being addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug. 
(Student(rina) ∧ Unaware(rina)) ⊕ ¬(Student(rina) ∨ Unaware(rina)) ::: Rina is either a student and unaware that caffeine is a drug, or neither a student nor unaware that caffeine is a drug. 
¬(Dependent(rina) ∧ Student(rina)) → (Dependent(rina) ∧ Student(rina)) ⊕ ¬(Dependent(rina) ∨ Student(rina)) ::: If Rina is not a person dependent on caffeine and a student, then Rina is either a person dependent on caffeine and a student, or neither a person dependent on caffeine nor a student.
Conclusion:
Jokes(rina) ⊕ Unaware(rina) ::: Rina is either a person who jokes about being addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
